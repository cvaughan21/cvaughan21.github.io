The first activity I began with was the GCFGlobal Search Better tutorial. While I am already very comfortable navigating search engines, namely Google, it was a nice refresher on some of the more hidden features in using Google, such as advanced search functions. I often find myself using a Google search for calculator and translation functions, as it can be quicker than pulling up a built-in calculator on your PC or a translator app on your cell phone. It also gives you the option to do something like copy and paste what you are trying to solve, rather than transpose it into the alternative application.  
The next activity I found interesting was learning about Search Engine Optimization. While not listed under activities, I read through the SEO Starter Guide linked in “Get your website on Google”. Some of the most interesting things I learned throughout these two readings were how you must to tailor your website to Google’s crawling. One of the most important things is having it linked by other websites. This would make sense to improve search results, as a website that is included in multiple other relevant sites would likely then also be relevant to the search query, potentially even more so. This would then increase the Search Engine Optimization of your website, as it would be recognized as relevant and shown in search results. The same is also true in reverse, in that linking other relevant resources to your website also improves your Search Engine Optimization. These are just some of the beginning and simple ways to make sure your website shows up in search results. 
One of the last activities I enjoyed most was using the Internet Archive. I have used the Wayback Machine in the past, both casually and for work purposes. I’ve used it to find nostalgic pages that I went to when I was younger, as well as used it at work to verify what information was displayed on a webpage at a specific date. I found the blog about ways to save pages interesting, as that is something I have not done and seems pretty easy to do. It helps preserve parts of the internet that you think might be worth saving, whether or not that website remains live in years to come. I used one of the examples on the Wayback Machine’s homepage to go to IMDB in 2013. After looking around I went all the way back to December 2000, which was very interesting how different and plain it was. I also liked the fact that one of the old ads was included, which was an Amazon ad from when they were only an online bookstore. The Internet Archive is great for both nostalgic purposes and research, and is both like a library and like a look back in time.
