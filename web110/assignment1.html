One of the first assignments I completed was the GFCGlobal Internet Basics. While I received a 23/25, on the quiz at the end, it was helpful to brush up on some of the commonly confused facts. For example, many people often refer to the Internet and the Web (World Wide Web) as interchangeable terms. In actuality, the Web is the collection of websites you can access through the Internet. This is an important distinction to be aware of, as the internet is not just the websites you see through your web browser. The Internet is actually a network of physical cables. When requests are sent to servers through these cables, websites are retrieved and sent to the corresponding computer. The cloud expands upon this by allowing files normally stored on a computer hard drive to be instead stored on these servers. Understanding the basics of how the internet functions is crucial to accomplish work with it. 

I found this next activity, GFCGLobal’s Window Bascis: Working with Files, to be a good refresher for me. Creating, deleting, and moving folders and files are all necessary parts of completing work on a computer. Knowing how to easily retrieve accidentally deleted files from the recycling has been very necessary for me in the past. Creating shortcuts to folders allows you to have an easy way to access files that are used regularly, while also providing a visual reminder on your desktop. Knowing how to find files later on is also very important, such as opening the last used application, searching for old file version names, and relocating and renaming the file after it is found so it does not get “lost” again. 

The last activity that I found particularly interesting were the article and two activities involving looking up my own IP address and IP geolocation. The Lifewire article talked about how to add a fake GPS location to your smartphone. While this could be helpful in many circumstances, the article also emphasized that VPNs would not accomplish this because their main objective is to instead hide your public IP address, and that very few also include a GPS override function. Whatismyipaddress.com simply showed me my IPv4 address, though the location it listed for my Internet Service Provider seemed a bit off. It did not detect a IPv6. The keycdn.com/geo tool then was able to more specifically show me where I was accessing the Internet from. These tools are all helpful as it is important to protect your own IP address from others on the Internet. If you were to use a VPN to hide yourself, these tools would be helpful to check if it is actually working as intended. The article is also a good reminder that just because the VPN is hiding you, it most likely will not display a new, fake GPS location for you instead.
