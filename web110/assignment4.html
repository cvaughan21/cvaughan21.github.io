One of the first activities that I completed I was actually able to use for my work. A lot of my job involves sending and replying to emails using Gmail, so completing this exercise was pretty routine for me. I replied to multiple emails in my inbox using a variety of functions, such as BCC to keep messages private, forwarding to share a message with someone not included on the original thread, and attaching files to send over. Using email is a daily routine for me, but having an understanding of how it works behind the scenes is both interesting and helpful. 

Next, I downloaded and set up Thunderbird. Setting it up to my existing email was very easy, and it worked similarly to any other email client I have used in the past, such as outlook. I sent an email to a friend with it very easily after linking my Gmail account. I then looked at some of the other features in Thunderbird. Many seemed similar to most other email clients, but I did enjoy the built in toolbar. The program felt similar to Microsoft Outlook, but did a better job of organizing my items. 

Lastly, I moved on to the activities about email spoofing. After reading the Wikipedia entry and the Livewire article, I highlighted a message in my inbox and inspected the original source. After viewing the original source information, I was able to determine that the message I had received had been sent by who I thought had sent it, and that no one had attempted to mislead me into opening the email by posing as someone else. While I am always more than hesitant to click on any suspicious links I receive, there can even be cybersecurity dangers associated with opening the message alone. Being able to verify who originally sent a message can be very important, especially if you donâ€™t immediately recognize the sender or what the message is regarding.
