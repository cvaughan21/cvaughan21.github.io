The first activity I began with was the social media tutorial from TutorialsPoint. While it was helpful, and definitely not a comprehensive list, I did notice it was missing some things, such as “Twitter” now being “X”, as well as Google Plus being now defunct since 2019. It did however remind me that I need to look over my LinkedIn, which led me to my next activity.

The next activity I focused on was the GCFGlobal tutorial on LinkedIn. While I do have a presence on LinkedIn and use it actively, it was a good refresher since I am not the most confident in my profile and building my LinkedIn network. This definitely served as a refresher to try to acquire some “recommendations” and “endorsements”. These are helpful sections on your profile which feature comments from others, with “recommendations” being about you as an employee as a whole, with “endorsements” being about your specific career skills. For yourself, being able to highlight your experience, skills, and your overall bio, can make you really stand out when searching for a new career or role. LinkedIn is a great social network that has a different spin on your typical social media platform, namely that it is meant for professional use. 

Lastly, I went over Smart Insights - The Honeycomb model. When using this model to evaluate the most popular social media platforms, there are a couple of surprising findings. In my opinion, YouTube ranks the lowest. While you can have your own profile and can make comments and messages, it isn’t really conducive to interacting with other individuals as you would on other sites. While people respond to comments and such, it falls low in “presence”, “relationship”, “conversations”, and “groups”. Pintrest is similar, in that users don’t often “meet” new people rather than follow them, and it similarly falls low in “presence”, “relationship”, “conversations”, and “groups”. Tumblr is better, in that conversations are relevant, but “presence” is still lacking. Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat and Facebook are all better in terms of the honeycomb model, and meet most if not all of them, as they allow for groups, active presence, conversations, relationships, sharing, and have established reputations.
