In completing my activities, I began with the GCFLearnFree: Internet Tips. This was helpful to go through as it gave a nice refresher on web browsers and highlighted the differences between them. I found the section on customizing your web browser interesting, as I planned to download multiple to complete the following activities. Being able to know how to designate a chosen start page, choose browser design themes, set up bookmarks, and see what add-ons and extensions are available for your chosen browser are all helpful skills when completing the initial browser setup in any situation, be it work or at home. These short readings set me up perfectly for my next activity. 

In terms of downloading new browsers, I already had Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome downloaded on my computer and was familiar with both, particularly Chrome. Because of this, I decided to download Opera and Mozilla Firefox. I’ve used both of these in the past, but not for a long time, and not to the extent I have used Chrome and Edge. The process of installing these was very straightforward and showed how easy it is to set up your preferred browser on a new device. I then went through the GFCLearnFree tutorial for Firefox and the Opera setup tutorial. Opera had some unique features that I enjoyed learning about, such as the integrated ad-blocker and their options for visual bookmarks. While Firefox did seem to have the standard security settings, such as displaying if a website is secure or disabling website tracking, I did not see a built-in ad blocker, which I found an intriguing difference between the two. 

Lastly, I found configuring browser settings to also be very interesting. When going through the browser customization topics offered in Firefox’s support pages, I found a tab about pop-up blocker settings. This meant that there was a form of an ad blocker within Firefox, meaning that my initial assumption about it not having one was incorrect. Opera showed me ways to integrate messaging apps and Opera pages like “bookmarks” and “history”. These are helpful for making your browser be personalized to your uses, such as for social purposes or being able to track down a previously used page. Overall, I found it a good experience to learn and set up new browsers, and see what differences they offer in performance, features, as well as user feel and accessibility.
